## Question
What is SQL?
SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is a programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. 
SQL provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to perform various operations such as creating, modifying, 
and querying databases and their respective tables.

With SQL, you can perform tasks such as:
1. Creating databases and tables: 
SQL provides commands for creating databases and defining the structure of tables, 
including specifying column names, data types, constraints, and relationships between 
tables.

2. Inserting, updating, and deleting data: 
You can use SQL statements to insert new records into tables, update existing records, 
and delete unwanted data from tables.

3. Querying data: 
SQL offers a rich set of commands for retrieving specific data from databases. You can 
use the SELECT statement to specify  the columns and conditions to filter the data you 
want to retrieve.

4. Modifying table structure: 
SQL allows you to alter the structure of tables, including adding or dropping columns, 
modifying data types, and applying constraints.

5. Managing database security: SQL provides commands to manage user access and permissions, 
allowing you to control who can view or modify the data in a database.

SQL is widely used in various database management systems, such as MySQL, Oracle Database, 
Microsoft SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and SQLite. It is a fundamental tool for working with 
structured data and is essential for tasks involving data storage, retrieval, and manipulation 
in relational databases.

## Question
What are the subsets of sql or types of sql commands?
SQL commands can be broadly categorized into the following subsets:

1. Data Definition Language (DDL): DDL commands are used to define and manage 
the structure of the database objects. They include commands such as:

   - CREATE: Creates a new database, table, view, index, or other database objects.
   - ALTER: Modifies the structure of existing database objects, such as tables or columns.
   - DROP: Deletes a database, table, view, index, or other database objects.
   - TRUNCATE: Removes all data from a table, while keeping the table structure intact.

2. Data Manipulation Language (DML): DML commands are used to manipulate and work with the 
data within the database. They include commands such as:

   - SELECT: Retrieves data from one or more tables.
   - INSERT: Inserts new data into a table.
   - UPDATE: Modifies existing data in a table.
   - DELETE: Deletes data from a table.

3. Data Control Language (DCL): DCL commands are used to control access and permissions to 
the database objects. They include commands such as:

   - GRANT: Provides user permissions to access specific database objects.
   - REVOKE: Removes user permissions to access specific database objects.

4. Transaction Control Language (TCL): TCL commands are used to manage transactions, which are 
units of work performed within a database. They include commands such as:

   - COMMIT: Saves all the changes made in the transaction.
   - ROLLBACK: Reverts all the changes made in the transaction.
   - SAVEPOINT: Creates a point in the transaction from which it can be rolled back.

These subsets of SQL commands provide the necessary tools to define, manipulate, control access, 
and manage transactions within a database system. The specific syntax and capabilities of these 
commands may vary slightly depending on the database management system being used.

## Question
Advantages and Disadvantages of SQL
SQL (Structured Query Language) has several advantages and disadvantages, which are outlined below:

Advantages of SQL:

1. Ease of Use: 
SQL has a simple and intuitive syntax that makes it easy to learn and use. Its declarative 
nature allows users to specify what they want to retrieve or modify without needing to 
specify how to do it. This makes SQL accessible to users with varying levels of technical expertise.

2. Portability: 
SQL is a standardized language that is supported by most relational database management systems 
(RDBMS). This means that SQL code written for one database system can often be used with minimal 
or no modifications on other database systems, providing a degree of portability.

3. Versatility: 
SQL provides a comprehensive set of commands for managing databases, querying data, and performing 
data manipulation operations. It supports a wide range of operations, including data retrieval, 
insertion, update, and deletion, as well as creating and modifying database structures.

4. Scalability: 
SQL databases can handle large amounts of data and scale to accommodate growing data volumes. 
They can efficiently manage complex queries, indexes, and relationships, making them suitable 
for handling both small and large-scale applications.

5. Data Integrity: 
SQL supports various integrity constraints, such as unique constraints, foreign key constraints, 
and check constraints. These constraints help ensure the accuracy and consistency of the data 
stored in the database.

Disadvantages of SQL:

1. Limited Support for Unstructured Data: 
SQL is primarily designed for structured data stored in tables with predefined schemas. 
It may not be the ideal choice for handling unstructured or semi-structured data, such 
as documents, multimedia files, or hierarchical data.

2. Performance Considerations: 
While SQL databases are generally efficient, complex queries or poorly optimized queries 
can impact performance. It requires careful database design, appropriate indexing, and 
query optimization techniques to ensure optimal performance.

3. Scalability Challenges: 
While SQL databases can handle large volumes of data, scaling them horizontally 
(across multiple servers) can be challenging. Distributed databases or NoSQL solutions 
may be more suitable for certain types of scalability requirements.

4. Vendor Dependencies: 
Although SQL is a standardized language, different database management systems may 
have variations in syntax, features, and optimizations. This can create vendor 
dependencies, making it challenging to switch between different database systems 
without modifying the SQL code.

5. Steep Learning Curve for Advanced Features: 
While SQL is easy to learn for basic querying and manipulation, mastering advanced 
features such as stored procedures, triggers, and complex joins may require additional 
effort and expertise.

It's important to note that the advantages and disadvantages of SQL can vary depending 
on the specific use case, requirements, and the choice of database management system.
